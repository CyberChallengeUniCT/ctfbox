Welcome to the FlagID API!

You can list all the valid flag IDs by using the GET /flagIds endpoint as described below.

You must filter results by adding the following query parameters:
- service: the ID of the service
- team: the ID of the team

Example: /flagIds?service=service1&team=team1

The flag IDs are returned as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "service1": {
    "team1": [
      "flag_id_service_1_team_1",
      "flag_id_service_1_team_1",
      "flag_id_service_1_team_1"
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
